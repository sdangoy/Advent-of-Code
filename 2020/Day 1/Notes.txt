Notes for Problem 1.1:

converting an array of strings to an array of numbers for number manipulation. Use array.map(Number)

How to find the TWO numbers that produce sum of 2020?
    number1 + number2 = 2020
    number2 = 2020 - number1 <- where number1 is a number from the array of numbers.

    If number2 is found in the array of numbers, then we have found the pair of numbers that when added together, equal 0. Return the two numbers and multiply them together
    for the answer

To check if a number is in the array of numbers, use array.includes(...) but this method uses a linear search or O(n). To be more efficient on the search, the number array
can be sorted first and use binary search for O(log n).

A note for sorting an array of numbers:
    array.sort() is made for lexographical/alphabetically comparisons, not for numbers. To sort numbers, .sort() can receive a compare function.

    For numerical, ascending order, use this compare function: .sort((a, b) => a-b);
    For numerical, descending order, use this compare function: .sort((a, b) => b-a);

    array.slice() is needed to store a reference to the newly sorted array because .sort() sorts the array in-place.

    The sorting would look like:
    const sortedArray = numberArray.slice().sort((a, b) => a-b);

Notes for Problem 1.2:

Creating a function to calculate the compliment will be useful because the same code will be repeated during this solution.

How to find the THREE numbers that produce sum of 2020?
    take a number in the array and subtract it by 2020 to find the necessary compliment to find. Exactly like the first question.
    
    firstCompliment = 2020 - number1 <- where number1 is a number from the array of numbers.

    take the compliment and repeat the process. Take the first compliment and subtract it from another number in the array. If the second number from the array is smaller
    than the first compliment, then it may be possible to find another number in the array that when added together, will equal the first compliment.
    
    if the second compliment exists in the array, then that means that there are two numbers in the array that equals the first compliment. There is another number in the
    array, that when added to the compliment, will have a sum of 2020.
    
    Visually, it will look like this:
    2020 = (number1 + (number2 + number3)) or 2020 = (number1 + (firstCompliment)) <- where number1 is a number from the number array.
    firstCompliment = 2020 - number1 AND firstCompliment = number2 + number3 <- where number2 is another number from the number array.
    number3 = firstCompliment - number2 <- if number3 is also found in the number array, then we have 3 values from the number array that equals 2020 when added together.
                                            Finally, just multiply them together for the answer.
